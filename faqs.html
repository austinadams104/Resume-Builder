          <h3>About Us:</h3>
          <p>Knowing where to place different information in a<br />
            resume is difficult. There are templates out there <br />
            for creating a resume, but our program will have an <br />
            interactive system making resume building even <br />
            easier. Our resume builder will have a user interface<br />
            that asks specific questions for users to respond <br />
            to, and then auto format all their responses into a <br />
            template. (this is a placeholder text)
